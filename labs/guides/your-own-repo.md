# Storing Class Materials in Your Own GitHub Repository

This guide offers the method of code organization and collaboration that we recommend.

## Git/GitHub Setup Steps

1. The labs are recommended to be completed in groups of 3, so we recommend [creating a GitHub organization](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?plan=free) for your group.

2. Create a new *public or private*[^1] GitHub repository and clone it to your machine. You can either make a new repository for each lab, or use the same repository for all labs.

3. If you made a private repository, give the instructors read-access to your repository. Their GitHub usernames are "dstrukov" and "sifferman".

4. Add [labs-with-cva6](https://github.com/sifferman/labs-with-cva6) as a submodule with `git submodule add git@github.com:sifferman/labs-with-cva6.git`.

5. If you ever need to change the commit of your [labs-with-cva6](https://github.com/sifferman/labs-with-cva6) submodule, you will need to do the following:

    1. `cd labs-with-cva6`
    2. `git pull origin main` to grab the latest commit, or `git checkout <COMMIT HASH>` to grab a specific commit
    3. `cd ..`
    4. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
    5. `git add labs-with-cva6`
    6. `git commit -m "<MESSAGE, i.e. updated labs-with-cva6>"`
    7. `git push origin main`

6. Add your source files to your repository where desired. You may optionally add a script to automatically overwrite CVA6's source files with your own source files.
